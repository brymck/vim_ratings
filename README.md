Installation
------------

When everything's ready for prime time, there will be a stable release in the
Chrome Web Store.

A packed, unstable version will always be available above as
[vim_ratings.crx](https://github.com/brymck/vim_ratings/blob/master/vim_ratings.crx?raw=true).

If you'd like to pack it from the source by yourself to ensure you have the
latest version, use the following:

### Windows

    git clone http://github.com/brymck/vim_ratings
    cd vim_ratings
    install\windows

### Linux
